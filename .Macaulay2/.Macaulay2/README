Welcome to Macaulay2!
			     
This directory is used to contain data and code specific to Macaulay2.  For
example, your initialization file, init.m2, is in this directory, and is
automatically loaded upon startup of Macaulay2, unless you use the "-q" option.
You may edit it to meet your needs.

The web browser file "index.html" in this directory contains a list of links to
the documentation of Macaulay2 and its installed packages and is updated every
time you start Macaulay2 (unless you use the "-q" option).  To update it
manually, use "makePackageIndex()".  Point your web browser at that file and
bookmark it.

You may place Macaulay2 source files in the subdirectory "code/".  It's on
your "path", so Macaulay2's "load" and "input" commands will automatically look
there for your files.

You may obtain source code for Macaulay2 packages and install them yourself
with the function "installPackage".  Behind the scenes, Macaulay2 will use the
subdirectory "encap/" to house the code for those packages in separate
subdirectories.  The subdirectory "local/" will hold a single merged directory
tree for those packages, with symbolic links to the files of the packages.

Good luck!
